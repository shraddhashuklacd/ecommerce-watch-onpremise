In general nice hostel very friendly stuff. Great location. The room was very small but ok. The biggest downside of this hostel is the combined toilets and showers. Most of them don't have windows and are poorly ventilated.  So it's horribly hot inside. The toilets are usually wet due to the fact that you shower over them. You aren't allowed to bring food into the room.,4,Nice hostel. Very bad showers/toilets.,Expedia,Quarters Hostel_Expedia

Deposit of $20 per key which are charge of $15 per key for admin fee if return to them after counter close. It is very inconvenient as we not sure what time we will be back to hostel. We have ask the counter regarding return of key and the deposit before we go out at morning the counter never remind us that they are no staff after 10.30pm. When we back at hostel already late night and no staff at counter. We tried to call the number listed at counter there was no one answer the phone. So early morning we just put the key at counter drawer and email them regarding deposit. Than they reply and refuse to pay back full amount and want to charge us $30 as we have request for another key. This is not our false right really unfriendly. PROS 1. Good location near mrt 2.

The service at reception was excellent staff was friendly and accomodating. We had a large room with comfortable bed the room is very clean and loved the bluetooth speaker. The location is perfect near city area Marina Bay and Singapore river. All in all it was a very pleasant stay and we enjoyed it a lot.,5,Excellent Stay,Expedia,The Fullerton Hotel Singapore_Expedia
Stayed in this hotel some years ago and loved our room and particularly the bathroom previously On this visit we were slightly disappointed with the first room we were given we requested another room and our request was actioned immediately. The second room was much better although the bathroom wasnâ€™t quite as nice as the one we had on our previous visit . As with all hotels there are nighttime glows of lights in the room which have to be covered to darken the room for sleeping and doors that bang woke up several times by other guests arriving and the door banging  Otherwise everything was really lovely. Bed was very comfortable staff were friendly and the location is superb,5,Bliss in The Fullerton,Expedia,The Fullerton Hotel Singapore_Expedia

The Room very comfortable and nice river room view.Near by MRT station and sightseeing place. Near Lau Pa Sat food court.,5,Good experience and excellent of Fullerton Hotel.,Expedia,The Fullerton Hotel Singapore_Expedia
The location is unbeatable you can do anything just walking and the building is just beautiful. Service is fantastic and very attentive breakfast was huge with Chinese Indian Japanese etc. All kinds of food and very well prepared and arranged. The pool is rather small but so nice and you're in the heart of CBD watching the riverside it's lovely! We had a very late flight and were given extra key cards after check out so we could still use the pool and showers which we appreciated a lot! Only downside our room was really tiny. More for single travellers we had almost not enough room in the cupboard for our stuff and we had to unpack as the 2 suitcases were way to big for that small room. Bathroom was huge though! Easy to walk to Lau Pa Sat for great food and only like 20 min walking to MBS. Loved the hotel would like to come back!,5,Wonderful heritage hotel right in the center,Expedia,The Fullerton Hotel Singapore_Expedia
The Fullerton tips a hat to the colonial past of Singapore whilst embracing all the modernity one would expect from a premier hotel. The staff cannot do enough to ensure your stay is faultless and the ammenities provided in the Straits Club are first class. In the literal but certainly not metaphorical shadows of the Marina Bay Sands the Fullerton is everything that a hotel should be; classical stylish and effortless. Simply put I would come to Singapore again just to stay at the Fullerton.,5,An outstanding and timeless hotel,Expedia,The Fullerton Hotel Singapore_Expedia
Although an historical building this hotel was renovated to be an excellent place to stay. It is just by the River walk and close to the Marina Bay. It is where we will stay next time again.,5,Historical hotel by the river and close to the bay,Expedia,The Fullerton Hotel Singapore_Expedia

This was a nice stay for four nights.  Not far from the metro (Clarke Quay was closest then Raffles Place).  Nice rooftop view ust above the 6th floor.  A great place to look around in 360. Good full breakfast with several choices.  Room was fine but bed was a bit small but adequate.  We would definitely stay here again.,5,Great Hotel close to lots of things.,Expedia,Jayleen 1918 Hotel_Expedia
The front desk staff are lovely the room is incredibly spacious and the location is great. The room particularly the bathroom needs an update. Not sure if all rooms had the same issue the shower drain in mine emitted a strong potent smell of sulfur. The bed was hard and the pillows exceptionally firm. If you like that you'll love the beds. Given the drawbacks the price I paid was not value for money.   The breakfast in the buffet was okay and was a good inclusion as many food places in Singapore don't open until later in the morning. The hotel is located near lots of good eateries and a couple of nice shopping precincts. The hotel is also located on the edge of Chinatown district which was convenient.  The location was great especially for the Singapore F1. Was also able to visit a lot of sites. However did rely upon taxis as means of getting around to some further sites such as the zoo.,3,Needs an update,Expedia,Jayleen 1918 Hotel_Expedia

Needed a cheap and cheerful hotel for a brief stop in Singapore. Wanted somewhere close to the travel hubs and Boat Quay.Hotel rooms are tiny but adequate for solo travellers with 1-2 days to kill who don't want or need a high end hotel.Staff are polite friendly and efficient.Breakfast is an 'experience' basic fare in a sister hotel a sort of Chinese 'caff' - plenty of Chinese restaurant leftovers available to supplement the cereal fruit and toast if you feel you need to top up your MSG levels.,3,Well located economy hotel,Expedia,Jayleen Clarke Quay Hotel_Expedia
This hotel is right opposite Clark Quay MRT so that was very handy. The room is tiny but there were a number of drawers for storage and room under the bed for luggage.

Near foodcourt and mrt. Nice staff hotel,5,Good,Expedia,Jayleen Clarke Quay Hotel_Expedia
I didn't enjoy my stay in the hotel. The first room we stayed in was very very small and one quarter of the floor space was taken up by glass partition enclosure that was the shower/WC. After a few days the solar hot water system failed and we had no hot water for nearly 3 days. To their credit the staff moved us to a 'deluxe' room which had lukewarm water. I have to be honest and say it was not value for money. I have stayed at a better budget hotel nearby.,2,Budget hotel in great location,Expedia,Jayleen Clarke Quay Hotel_Expedia
If youÂ´re just looking for a bed in a convenient area this hotel is excellent. Seems secure and they accommodated our early arrival. The only downside is the really really tiny room and bathroom (you can shower and use the toilet at the same time basically) but given it's Singapore I think we can't fault them for that.,4,Really small room but OK for a short stay.,Expedia,Jayleen Clarke Quay Hotel_Expedia
Staff were courteous and helpful.Hotel was clean and location was ideal. Close to bus and train system and restaurants on the waterway.Close to shopping venues.Excellent place to stay. ,5,,Expedia,The Quay Hotel_Expedia
The Quay Hotel is well maintained but the rooms are too small to adequately cater for two travellers with large suitcases etc.  The breakfast is basic but certainly adequate.  The rooms are clean the staff are excellent and the hotel is well situated near a metro station and with a bus stop right outside the front door. If the small room is not an issue I would gladly recommend this place.,3,Room too small for travellers,Expedia,The Quay Hotel_Expedia
The room was quite unlike what we expected and saw on the website.  As small as we have ever seen and no window to the world.  Shower ran out of hot water and breakfast did not start till 8am - too late.  From the look of where it was provided it looked disappointing too.,2,Tiny room,Expedia,The Quay Hotel_Expedia

The room itself was pretty small and cosy but had a comfortable bed private bathroom and had all you needed.  The bonus was definitely having the use of a smartphone with unlimited Internet to explore Singapore without having to get a tourist simcard!  Breakfast was pretty average however was still all we needed for our 2 night stay in Singapore.  The hotel is located about a 5min walk from Clarke Quay and also about a 10min walk from Chinatown.

The lady at check in was not friendly and lost on 'first impression'.,3,A convenient hotel with very tiny room.,Expedia,Hotel Clover 7_Expedia
"Room was small and windowless as advertised.  Felt a bit cramped but it was advertised.  Wifi was good but was slow for VPN.  The staff delivered on the free water and soda. Hotel was situated close by to the MRT at Clarke Quay served by the North East line.  I found Exit A to be the closest entrance as this avoided having to cross New Bridge Road.  Bus service on South Bridge Road was also very convenient.  The hotel was walking distance to Chinatown Clarke Quay and Boat Quay.  It was easily transit-able to further places like Orchard Road Harborfront and the Esplanade.  Lots of little shops close by for a snack or a meal.  Hawker markets also nearby in Chinatown.Onto the cons: the night light for the bottom of the bed had to stay on for the reading lamps to work.The elevator was very annoying if you can hear it.  The beeps when the doors open and close are very annoying.  The announcements on the elevator for ""door opening"" and ""door closing"" are also useless as the door has already completed the function",4,As advertised - small windowless room,Expedia,Hotel Clover 7_Expedia
Only drawback was the extremely small size of the room. There was no room to even open a suitcase without using the bed. If you travel with a very large suitcase then you wonâ€™t be able to get it under the bed.  Apart from the room size everything else was superb the service cleanliness and breakfast all excellent.  Would stay again but be better prepared.,4,Excellent but very small,Expedia,Hotel Clover 7_Expedia

Solo traveling in Singapore and this hotel was more than sufficient. The room was small but perfect for one person to crash in.

The location was convenient with a 10 minute walk to public transportation convenient pick up and drop off for Uber drivers and also central to many sites to see.

The hotel is perfecly located in downtown Singapore. While it seems to have been recently renovated the windows soundproofing was absolutely nonexistant and was the biggest issue during our stay. It was so bad it was like having no windows at all. You could hear every discussion happening in the street below. As it is a street with lots of bars and activity at night you can imagine how unpleasant nights can be.,4,Perfectly located hotel but badly soundproofed,Expedia,Hotel Clover 7_Expedia

Modern and clean hotel orientated to people who spend more time exploring city rather than hotel. Location was very good 20 min walk to Marina Bay or 15 min walk to Chinatown. Personnel very friendly and professional. Though room with a window would have been more pleasant. It does have nice swimming pool on the roof with decent view. Very good hotel for the Singapore Price range.,4,Budget hotel near attraction area,Expedia,Fragrance Hotel - Riverside_Expedia
Pros: Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. The location is pretty good close to a station and a 7-eleven. They give you free water bottles which they replace everyday.Cons: Poor sound proofing very noisy at night. Super small not enough space if you have big luggages. The water temperature is inconsistent only had one hot shower in my 3 nights there. Overall would not recommend would look for something else.,3,You get what you pay for: very small room,Expedia,Fragrance Hotel - Riverside_Expedia
location is good near clarke quay and a short walk to chinatown. hotel room a bit small and shower didnt have a door or anything just a shower head not sure if it was just our room or not. asked for a new towel on sunday and they said they ran out.. usually hotels have towels for the pool area and they didnt so maybe bring your own towel..,2,its OK,Expedia,Fragrance Hotel - Riverside_Expedia
We were put in a minuscule apartment with NO WINDOWS and a wet room style shower (in other words there was no shower there was just a shower head over a toilet). Mold was growing all over the bathroom because of this design. This being said the staff were wonderful and very helpful the pool is really nice and the location is fantastic. If ur looking for a cheap stay and are happy to camp in a moldy shoe box this'll suit your needs.

Staff were very friendly and welcoming gave me and early Check in after my early flight. The bed was comfortable and there was some drawer storage. Only thing I missed was somewhere to hang my shirts. There was a ladder type thing you can use but it's not great. The room I was in had space for a closet or even just a rod. Minor niggle.

The room was a good size and had a reasonably upmarket feel. What I really liked was that since this was more of a serviced appartment than a hotel room it came with features like washing machine and large fridge (and dishwasher but I never used that) which made my 5 day stay very easy (I go running or use the gym a lot so being able to easily wash laundry is a big positive being able to store basic food (and wine) is also a big positive). Staff were friendly and polite and helpful too. Gym equipment is a bit sparse and not my taste but at least I had somewhere to exercise. The glass sided pool is a fun novelty make sure to bring goggles so you can enjoy the city view from underwater! Location was good sited next to a subway station. And Marina Bay Sands complex is just a short walk away (7 mins). I would definitely use again if I am doing business in that area in future.,4,More of an appartment than a hotel.

The room and hotel is nice enough. However no room service after 9:30 pm and no mini-bar.  Granted lots of places to eat locally.

The good news is that the Southbridge Hotel is in Singapore's Chinatown and is reasonably clean.The bad news is that the rooms are TINY....no more than 100 square feet for the bedroom and bath.  Also our only window was painted over and did not open.  The price was good but I would have gladly paid for a larger room or different hotel but we had just flown in from San Francisco were very tired and I did not want that hassle.  I would not recommend this hotel to any other people.,2,Tiny room....No window,Expedia,The Southbridge Hotel_Expedia
Booked this place because it has a nice looking bar on the ground floor two actually. And because of its central location near a lot of the attractions and only 10min walk from boat quay.Because of previous reviewers complained about the music being loud and the standard rooms being small and dark I booked a deluxe room. The room was very nice clean and spacious enough. The bed was really comfortable and large. Only downside about it is the fact that everything gets wet if you shower.The atmosphere at the hotel wasn't all that lively which I hoped. As a solo traveller its nice to meet fellow travellers. The bar was not that busy most of the time and the people there seemed mostly local not traveller. Not the hotel's fault though. Breakfast seemed decent enough allthough i didn't use it. There were no glutenfree options so i was told. This made the price i paid a bit high (95 euro a night). Other than that no complaints.,4,Solid stay.,Expedia,The Southbridge Hotel_Expedia
