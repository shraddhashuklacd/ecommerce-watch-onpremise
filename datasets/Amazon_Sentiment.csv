Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,15-07-17 0:00,Yes I remember,"Yes I remember what Pears was like before the reformulation but if one is to be fair it should now be compared to what is now available on the market. Look at it that way and it is pretty good even if it melts away twice as fast as it once did.

Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2017-08-07 00:00:00,Do not Buy!,"Buyer beware on this item. I have used Pears soap for many years, originally in the U.K. growing up when it was still made by Andrew Pears & Co. Unfortunately, Pears was bought out by Unilever and as is often the case when Unilever buys something, the quality goes down. I have still purchased it for a number of years from amazon, but the latest shipment has no resemblance to either the original or the modified Unilever product. It is now essentially ALL chemicals and color. It is now obviously being sourced from another manufacturer and claiming to be ""Pears"" soap."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2017-02-07 00:00:00,Five Stars,very comfortable. Would buy it again.

Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,14-06-17 0:00,Pears glycerin is still my favorite.,"Pears is my go to brand of glycerin soap. I became allergic to my soap many years ago. I used the same brand for about 30 years and started to notice that I seemed to be allergic so I switched to Pears. I don't have any problems with Pears. However, something with the factory went sideways and I could not get this (I was paying $1 a bar at the dollar store). Then when I could not get Pears (except on Amazon at a very high cost) I bought a bunch of glycerin soaps and so far they all seem good. Pears is still my favorite."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2017-11-06 00:00:00,It was Grandmother's soap too,"The Pears soap ad from c 1900 picture of a young girl saying grace before her meal in bed while her cat and dog watch her is still available on-line. Its adorable. My Grandmother won an original of it in her Amish Sunday school class for memorizing a Bible verse, and she had it framed in her bedroom all of her life. I have it now. OF COURSE I'm going to use Pears soap!"
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2017-11-06 00:00:00,Five Stars,Love it
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2017-10-06 00:00:00,LOVE IT,"I have been using pears soap for more than 6 months. My forehead had a lot of small pimples (little pimples that look like bumps), I tried many of the known brands but nothing seem to work. My boyfriend bought pears for me, after using pears for 1 week I noticed less pimples on my forehead. Now after 6 months my forehead looks clear, no more small pimples. I have acne on my back and pears has helped with that too. So I use pears to wash my body and my face, I wash my face with pears only in the night and then I apply my moisturizer (organic jojoba oil). After using so many many products I have learned that a simple skin care routine along with natural products are the perfect combination. Note: Only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because I feel that I see better results on my face than my back."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2017-09-06 00:00:00,Incorrect list of ingredients,"I purchased this product because it stated ""Original""..and listed the 8 original ingredients, the product received was the remade product with 23 ingredients. I was unaware of the change and couldn't understand why I had such a terrible rash, once I learned of the change and reviewed the ingredients I immediately stopped using it as I am extremely allergic to sulfates. Be careful when ordering this."

Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2017-04-06 00:00:00,Another great product down the drain,"After receiving my order and opening the first bar, I found this is a different soap than I'd previously purchased. Other users have indicated the product was sold to another company and there are some differences. ESPECIALLY the original fragrance. Sorry, this is a really BIG DEAL to me. If you were familiar with the Pear's box that had ""By Appointment to..."" and a seal on the upper right of the box then this new soap will take some adjustment. (Or replacement). Another great product down the drain!"

Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,30-05-17 0:00,Pears Soap is the Best,Pears soap is the best. We have used it for about 30 years.
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,29-05-17 0:00,A 5-STAR PRODUCT IF THERE EVER WAS ONE!!!,"Don't listen to the nay-sayers. This is GREAT soap. I use it every day and when camping or travelling it is all I take. I can bathe completely, then shampoo my hair, and even shave with it. It suds really well and has a wonderful feel that will leave you squeaky clean but won't dry you out. Wifey likes it too. She says it leaves her face and skin soft and moist. And as an added bonus, it doesn't completely trash my tubs and showers like almost every other bar soap on the planet. For those who might not know this, that nasty crud that builds up on your tubs and showers is almost completely made up of the scum left behind by the talc and lye in your ""normal"" soaps, body washes and shampoos. For this reason, Pears transparent, glycerin-based soap is the only one allowed in my house, along with a few other clear body washes and shampoos. The rule of thumb here is, if you can't see through it it isn't welcome in my bathrooms. I have 4 people under my roof, and nasty tubs and showers used to cause a lot of grief. Now it isn't a problem at all. A thorough cleaning is only necessary a few times a year and it takes just a few minutes without the usual harsh, toxic chemicals. This reason alone should be enough to love this soap. The unique smell does take a little getting used to. It isn't strong or offensive mind you, but it is definitely unlike any other bar of soap. Wifey, who has overly sensitive bloodhound nostrils and hates all strong odors, does love the smell of Pears soap. Anyway, it is mostly just neutral, so we can choose how we will smell based solely on the aftershaves, perfumes and colognes we decide to go with. I don't know about any ""new formulas vs old formulas"", or whatever some folks are griping about. I just know it is a great soap now and it always had been a great soap. It is one of my favorite household discoveries of the last 40 years. Again, don't listen to the nay-sayers. Try it for a month and you will agree. Use it along with clear body washes and shampoos for 6 months and you will never go back to scrubbing soap scum once a month. A five star product if there ever was one!"

Pears Soap originated in 1789, and it is the world's oldest continuous soap brand, I believe. So they did something right, if longevity is the test. I like the soap, especially for showers or .bath, and have been using it for years. I first became acquainted with Pears Soap while I was reading Paul Scott's ""Raj Quartet"", and quite by chance I found the gold and green soap in a Bangkok mall when I was living there. I haven't been without Pears since."

Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,25-01-17 0:00,DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING: Not the Pears Soap we knew.,"This is a very poor soap, totally reformulated and chemicalized by Unilever when they bought the original great brand in 2009. The packaging is deceptive: it shows an almost-clear, pure soap and is advertised on the box as ""Pears transparent soap."". What you get is a muddy gold, almost opaque soap with more chemical ingredients than you can shake a stick at: ""water, sodium palm kernelate, sorbitol, sodium roseate, sodium palmate, glycerin (FINALLY!!!!!!), sodium stearate, propylene glycol, sodium laurel sulfate, PEG-4, ......."" etc, etc. The soap has a chemically smell, not at all like the original Pears soap.

Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,22-08-16 0:00,Affordable in 12-packs - Good Soap!,"I was introduced to Pears' when I stayed in the UK for some months. I enjoyed it very much, but it isn't for sale in stores in the US (at least, not where I live). I have found it in catalogs, but it's quite expensive - they tend to sell by the single bar, and it was just way too expensive. Then I ran across the 12-pack. They have the price down to something reasonable; probably still a bit high compared to other soap, but reasonably close to the price I paid in the UK. The soap is a hard mill, which means it lasts for a long time. It's a big soap, too -- when first opened, it's almost hard to hold in one's hand. One of the things I've really enjoyed about Pears' over the years is that as the bar gets used up, the suds-making power stays present. Most soaps, as the bar wears down, seem to lose this."

Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,20-06-16 0:00,Disappointing Unilever knockoff of the original,"When I lived in London a few decades ago, I used to buy Pears glycerine soap. It cleaned well, rinsed clean, and it had a nice, subtle fragrance. So when I saw 12 bars for a good price, I jumped at it. Alas, prior to receiving the soap, I didn't read the various reviews that mention that 1) the soap has been reformulated since Pears was acquired by Unilever, and 2) that the soap doesn't have the same subtle fragrance. This is not the Pears soap that I enjoyed. Rather, it is cloudier in appearance and has a very strong antiseptic odor that overwhelms the old subtle herbal scent of the soap. Leave it to a multinational conglomerate to ruin a brand that's been around for a few hundred years. This is not the wholesome Pears of the past. It's a cheap knockoff. While it's better than, say, Irish Spring, it doesn't compare to what it was. Very disappointed."

Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2016-04-03 00:00:00,Pears Transparent Original Soap,"I was having problems with my hands splitting during the winter months. Then I remembered a brand my Grandparents used Pears Transparent soap. I remembered that it has Glycerin in it and that was what as a child we used to keep our hands soft. We used pure Glycerin on our hands with gloves to sleep to keep the glycerin from messing up the sheets. I started using Pears Transparent Original Soap over a year ago and with almost 2 winters behind us, my hands have stayed free of splits. I also like it because it does not mess up the soap dish like regular bar soaps do."

It's a great every day soap for hand and body washing in the shower, though it's a little drying on the face so use caution there. One downside is that a bar of Pears melts rather quickly as do mostly all glycerin soaps, so bulk up if you are a huge fan of this product."

It's a high quality bar that lasts a while, but the best part is the smell. Sort of a frankincense and camp fire mix? My only complaint is the ingredient list. As we move towards more natural products, I was very disheartened to see Pears begin including a ton of chemicals (preservatives, detergents, stabilizers, etc) beginning in 2009. I'm not sure why the product was unchanged for 200 years but now required the addition of these items? I'm tempted to lower the star rating further because of this. Until I find a more natural product that smells as good, though, I plan to keep using this."

It also lasts a great deal longer than other transparent soaps such as Neutrogena. It's true that in the old days, decades ago, Pears made in England was an even better product, with a nicer perfume. Now it's made in India by a different (cheaper) manufacturing process, with a too-strong, not very pleasant, inferior perfume. The original English soap was dried slowly, which naturally produced the big dimple on each side of the soap bar. Now the dimple is artificial, shaped in a mold."

Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,19-02-15 0:00,I was pleased to discover it in the 99 cent stores,"I first tried Pears in 1973, when I lived in the UK. I have very sensitive skin, but found it gentle, and I adore the fragrance. Over the years, in the USA, it has proved difficult to find. Most drugstore chains do not carry it. I was pleased to discover it in the 99 cent stores, but it was not that cheap - a dollar a bar. But I was very happy to be able to recreate the experience of using a mild, gentle, soap that was actually quite long-lasting. I was pleased to see that Amazon sells a dozen bars for considerably less than my local discount stores. I had not read the reviews of this product before purchasing it, and frankly, I can't understand the negative reviews. There are no soaps that are ""all natural."" Does anyone here know how soap is made? It used to be made at home, using lard and lye (sodium hydroxide), an extremely caustic substance. People are needlessly afraid of ""chemicals"" that are present in virtually all retail toiletries. I am a health professional with an additional background in the hard sciences, and I must say that there is needless controversy over the ""chemicals."" I find many people similarly terrified of the substances of vaccines, and they shouldn't be. If you have a particular sensitivity or allergy to one of the components of this soap, your point is well taken, but this will not be true for everyone. If that were so, the product would never have made it to market. In addition, is only recently that full disclosure of the constituents of such products was mandated, so perhaps Pears has not changed as much as you think it has."

Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2014-01-12 00:00:00,Pear's Soap,I just opened on of my latest batch of Pear's Soap and I didn't notice any of the negative things expressed by other commentators. I've used this soap for 40+ years and never use any other at home. It's gentle and mild and leaves no residue. To me the aroma is pleasantly subtle and not over powering. It arrived promptly and was well packed.
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,29-11-14 0:00,I like this because it's less expensive and lasts much longer ...,I like this because it's less expensive and lasts much longer than the other glycerin soap I've tried. I'm a long-time user of this product.
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,24-11-14 0:00,I love it's amber color,"I've used this soap since after my birth in 1939, having been introduced to it by a grandmother in St. Louis, Missouri. I love it's amber color, its smell and over all appearance of not having a lot of chemical ingredients, except a simple combination delighting me all these years. Perhaps it's just my personal history of this Pears Soap, but I do love it and give a bar as a gift on occasions."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2014-07-11 00:00:00,Five Stars,Its the best soap.

Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2014-06-09 00:00:00,Lots Of Nice Soap For A Good Price,"I like this soap a lot - mild, pleasant, works well, and looks cool (transparent/translucent) - and this was a good price on a fairly large quantity. Product and seller both recommended."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,31-08-14 0:00,Five Stars,"Fast, inexpensive, delivered to my house...can't beat that!"
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,25-08-14 0:00,Good for sensitive skin,It's the only soap I can use that doesn't make my skin itch. Neutrogena got too expensive and I love the smell of rosemary.
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,23-08-14 0:00,The Only Soap You Need!,"I've loved this soap for more than forty years! It's been increasingly difficult to find it in stores, though, and to find it at a good price. The twelve bars from Amazon arrive in perfect condition, and will last you about twelve weeks, even if you are an avid user, as I am. The price is a little more than you would pay at a discount store, but sometimes those stores are out of stock, have only a few bars, or have bars that are broken. It's well worth spending a bit extra to have the availability, quantity, and quality you want. This soap is great for all skin types, for an all-over wash, just hands, or even for your face. Once you try Pears, I doubt you will want any other soap."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,14-08-14 0:00,Good for those with soap allergies,"Over a year ago I ordered this soap because it was recommended for those who have allergic reactions to many soaps. Since then, I have since reordered twice and given a few bars away to family members with similar problems. Obviously I have been pleased."

Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2014-10-05 00:00:00,Pears Soap,"This is my favorite soap...not too scented and gentle, and the price was excellent.I highly recommend this very good product."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2014-06-05 00:00:00,"Horrible, horrible smell",WHY do companies change the ingredients in long-time favorites? This soap smells so bad I had to air out the bathroom. It smells like industrial-strength floor cleaner. And the chemicals in the ingredients! What were they thinking?
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,24-04-14 0:00,Nice Soap,"This soap feels good, gets to the oil on my face and gets the job done. My favorite soap. Works great on sensitive skin."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,19-04-14 0:00,Same good old quality,These bars are of the sams qualith they had been when I was a child. I will keep buying them.
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,17-04-14 0:00,love this soap,"Of all soaps I have ever used, this one is the best. I sometimes feel itchy after a shower (dermatologists have a name for this), but with Pears this is minimized. Only problem is that the bar doesn't last very long."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,17-03-14 0:00,Great,This soap does a really good job. It makes your skin feel nice and clean plus the fragrance is also enjoyable.
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,18-02-14 0:00,Fresh and Clean,"This is the way soap should be: translucent, free of perfumes and dyes and easy to hold. I love collecting beautiful, expensive soap from the best shops around the world. The problem has been that their scents can be overpowering. Pears is unique because it's so radically simple. I find myself stockpiling Pears and putting a bar in every bathroom and sink in the house."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2014-10-02 00:00:00,The only bath/shower soap I use,"I got onto Pears a long time ago and I can't imagine using anything else. Yes, the aroma has changed (not for the better, I fear--it smells a bit ""medicine-y"" now, although that abates some with use) but otherwise, it's the same old Pears and my skin is very happy. I'm glad I can get it in bulk from Amazon--much more economical."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2014-05-02 00:00:00,My family has used this for years!,"This is a wonderful bar soap that lasts and doesn't just become a sloppy mess in the soap dish. Very mild, yet cleanses and deodorizes the skin."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,29-12-13 0:00,I have used Pears soap for years,"I like this product. People say they Pear's has changed the manufacturing process but the soap works well for me. I use it twice a day, everyday, and have for years. I highly recommend it."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,27-12-13 0:00,Great soap...,Great soap at a great price....have used it for years but seems to have disappeared in brick and mortar stores.
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2013-11-12 00:00:00,Old fashioned soap,"It takes me back to my childhood ,this is a hard soap that lasts longer and has a very pleasant aroma, does not get mushy."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2013-09-12 00:00:00,Excellent soap for dry skin,"Very good for people with dry skin, or for people who want to avoid dry skin. This is the first time I ordered from Amazon rather than going to a retail outlet."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2013-03-11 00:00:00,Best Soap,This is the best soap in the world. It reminds me of growing up in South Africa where only my richer neighbors used it.
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,23-10-13 0:00,Pear Soap high quality,This soap is now and has been a favorite - cleans well and lasts much longer than softer bar soaps.
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,14-10-13 0:00,Pears soap display,"For many hears I have had an old Pears Soap advertisement page out of the Harper's Weekly magazine from the late 1800s. It was framed and in my bathroom for years with a bar of Pears soap in a small dish beside it. I moved into a house with a massive bathroom and had the advertisement enlarged to hang over the tub. The ad has a beautiful woman in a footed tub reaching over for a bar of Pears soap from a huge stacked display by the tub. Truthfully, the soap smells a little bit like medicine, but it is attractive and I needed several bars to re-enact the ad. I love the look and have always been pleased with whatever I've ordered from Amazon."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,16-09-13 0:00,Fast delivery and good price,"This is my favorite soap for bathing, but I can't always find it in the drugstores, so I rely on being able to buy a few bars at a time. This company had the best price and they were fast."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2013-11-09 00:00:00,Five Stars,This is always a favorite of ours. Came as expected and no package damage.
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2013-08-09 00:00:00,The best!,"I've been using this soap for years and I love it. Every time I try another soap, I end up coming back to Pears."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,27-08-13 0:00,Gteat soap,Bought pear soap because it was reccomended to us. WOW.. We won't use any other soap again. Washs clean amd rinses off great.
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2013-07-07 00:00:00,We use this almost exclusively.,"I like this soap and my husband loves it. He is allergic to most soaps and is delighted with Pears. I like the way it smells and I'v always liked ""see-through"" soaps."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2013-03-07 00:00:00,All the Pears you need without hunting through the shops,"This is the Indian version of Pears which is supposed to be closer to the original Pears than the British version. hey, it works."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2013-08-06 00:00:00,Lovely,Reminiscent of old England. Gentle fragrance from the moment you open the inner wrap. Wonderfully moisturizing. Keep as dry as possible after use to avoid waste.
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2013-09-05 00:00:00,Great product,"Is a joy to use, lathers well. My wife likes how I smell after I shower with it. If there is a negative it would be that the bar does not seem to last very long."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2013-06-05 00:00:00,English Pears Soap,"I absolutely love my case of Pears Soap. It has such a lovely scent and is so easy to use. I have used it all my life,"
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2013-01-04 00:00:00,Original soap is not the original soap that was produced in England.,"Although the box lists the product as being the ""original"" Pears soap, the product in the box definitely was not. I believe that there is a certain amount of deceit on the part of the new Indian ownership of the company in listing the product as ""original"". It certainly was not the soap that I had been using for the last 40 years."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,29-11-12 0:00,"This is great soap, ignore the nay-sayers","A couple of years back Pears decided to reformulate its soap, including changing its distinctive scent. This was an odd move, given that this is (I believe) the longest-running product in the world, and given that people don't like change. But once you get used to the new scent, or if you weren't familiar with the old scent in the first place, this is excellent glycerine soap. Pears soap is free from animal products, which is important to those of us who are vegetarian or vegan. I find the scent pleasing. It's long-lasting soap compared to other glycerine soaps that I've used. It doesn't go mushy, like other glycerine soaps. And one of the famous features of this soap is that the sliver of old soap fits neatly into the hollow on a new bar, so that you don't waste any of it. The price is also very reasonable. Many of the glycerine soaps in my local health-food store are $5 or so per bar. I'd highly recommend this soap."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,2012-04-10 00:00:00,This is NOT the original Pears!!,"I ordered this because I (foolishly) believed that it was POSSIBLE that these were some of the leftover orignal Pears. I was wrong, but I decided to keep the 12 bars anyway. Hopefully, if I take them out of their cellophane bags well before I want to use them, they won't smell so bad. Still, I'm stuck with the extra crap they've added to the new (Indian) formula."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,19-05-12 0:00,Change is bad,The new formula is terrible. If you are used to the old Pears soap this will be a giant dissappointment.
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,30-04-12 0:00,pears soap,"We have been using Pears soap for years and it is appropriate for everyone in the family. It is hard to find it in stores, but ordering it by the dozen bars on the internet is easy and practical."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,22-09-11 0:00,DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT PEARS ORIGINAL FORMULA SOAP,"The description of this Pears soap is deliberatley misleading, as it uses the word ""original"" which makes you believe it is the original 9 component formula of Pears soap. It is not....and you can buy this In dollar stores for a lot less. I was disppointed when i received the order after having checked other AmericaRx products elsewhere on Amazon which show the original formula as part of their description. That led me to belive I was buying the same product, which it is not. Do not waste time and money on buying this, which is the new formula with added chemical ingredients.The real original formula box has 2 soap bars on it and states it is Hypo-allergenic and non-comedogenic."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,25-08-11 0:00,Great!,"My husband loves this soap! No soap-scum residue. Light fragrance, not flowery. I would highly recommend this product to anyone."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,31-05-11 0:00,Seems ok to me,"Pears may have changed the soap formula, but it has the same gentle and refreshing lather and cleaning power. The new formula has a bit of a medicinal smell."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,15-10-10 0:00,Pears Soap - Lost and Found,"I found Pears soap in New York City in 1979, when I moved there from Geneva, Switzerland. It was the most satisfactory soap I'd ever used. But when I moved to Seattle in 1981, it wasn't available locally, life intervened, and I gave up looking for it. Now I have lived in Mexico for the last 17 years. One day, I was tooling around Amazon looking at books, and discovered Pears soap! I immediately ordered it and I'm very excited about using it again. My sister in Texas is holding it for me, along with some books. We will pick it up in a week when we drive up to visit and I'm looking forward to experiencing that clean, fresh fragrance again."
Bathing Soap,amazon.com,Pears Transparent Original Soap,22-09-10 0:00,I bought it with reservations but I'm happy I did.,"I read the previous reviews, both pro and con, and was concerned about the change in formula and the different smell this created. However, I have been unable to buy my beloved Pears Soap for a couple of years now and I missed it dearly. With reservation, I bought the 12 pack and I'm glad I did. Yes, the smell isn't the same as the old English soap but it does the job. That wonderful squeeky clean feel after you shower is worth the change. It's kind to your skin and that's what matters. To those of you who are undecided, I'd say go ahead and try it."

Since it is a moisturizing product, maybe some of the reviewers who say it's greasy have oilier hair. This is the first ever root boost that I've ever used that isn't tacky or sticky or difficult to brush through. To those who are complaining that it doesn't hold their hair, it is NOT a hairspray, so don't expect it to act like one. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it has a nasty, chemical odor. Fortunately, it doesn't leave a smell once it's dry. I hope that it is eventually revised to have a fresh, clean scent."

Shampoo,amazon.com,Loreal Shampoo,2016-09-11 00:00:00,It was only a mattr of time before somebody figured this out. What a revelation!,"Extraordinary oil, indeed! My hair was pin-straight, long and silky most of my life, but since I have gotten older, and regularly dye it, the strands have become a little more wiry, dry, stubborn and flyaway.more prone to just stick out, or stick together. So I tried leaving conditioner on forever, then adding a few drops of coconut oil or almond oil, and combing it through, but both of those oils were sticky. Then I triad argan oil, and finally tamed the wayward strands. What a revelation! I guess it was only a matter of time before somebody smart added oils to the shampoo and conditioner. I love this stuff! The shampoo foams up well, and rinses out well. The conditioner is luxurious; your hair untangles immediately and feels slippery. It feels like it takes a little extra time to fully rinse and dry your hair, but it is so well-behaved when you're done! I actually tried adding three drops of argan oil afterwards, but that was overkill. In fact, I discovered that my hair behaves even better on the second day, and maybe the third day, so now I wash it every other day."

Shampoo,amazon.com,Loreal Shampoo,16-10-16 0:00,Best one! Love how my hair feels!,"I've tried so many different hair products and they all failed. For me, I was looking for shampoo+ conditioner that would leave and feel my hair moisturized and have frizz control. I was never satisfied with any one of them, and I must have tried about 10 different products. Before trying L'OrÃƒÂ©al, Suave's Almond and Shea Butter was product I was pretty happy with, but L'OrÃƒÂ©al was far better. Conditioner is really thick compared to other regular conditioners, and the moment you put it on your hair, you could already feel the softness. Normally, my hair gets pretty frizzy if I let air dry (I'm in L.A. where there's minimal humidity), but other than my natural curls, frizz control was the best. Moreover, my hair feels so much softer and moisturized. Because of my frizzy hair, I would always use straighten iron to straighten my hair, and my hair would feel all dried afterward. However, L'OrÃƒÂ©al didn't leave my feeling dry. Even after using straighten iron, it still felt soft and moisturized, and I didn't even use any ""after"" leave in products. I think this L'OrÃƒÂ©al can beat most of hair products in ""frizz control"" and ""silky hair"" categories. I've finally found a product and I'm happy that it's not one of those professional products that cost $$$. Hope it works the same for others who have been searching for frizz control, feeling silky and moisturized hair."

Shampoo,amazon.com,Loreal Shampoo,2016-05-03 00:00:00,Over all it is great!,1st I want to say the shampoo AND conditioner made my hair (and my skin especially my hands) feel AMAZING! The conditioner is wonderful! My hair felt great! I was worried it was gonna make my look greasy but it didn't. It even left my skin feel so soft and smooth! However the shampoo seems very runny/watering and I had to wash with it 3 times before my hair felt clean and I had to use more than I normally would. For that reason Im not sure if I would buy it because with the amount I had to use the bottle would go very quickly. But I will say this is the 1st and ONLY shampoo I have ever used that after washing my hair (before conditioning) that my hair felt soft and somewhat manageable. Generally after shampoo my hair feels very dry and is a tangled mess so that is really impressive! My girlfriend also tried it and she did NOT have that issue so I guess it depends on your hair. Another thing the smell isn't the greatest... it doesn't smell bad but it also doesn't smell good. But the softness it gave my hair is worth the trade off there. *L'Oreal provided a product sample for review purposes*

Shampoo,amazon.com,Loreal Shampoo,2016-03-03 00:00:00,NEED TO TRY THIS OUT!! WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!,"The whole outlook of the bottles and appeal to buy them is great. The design of the bottles is not only easy on the eyes, but they are very convenient with the wide stand bottoms that allow the sitting of ease. The bottle is universal in this also as it can be turned upside down and used either way for storage. Starting with Shampoo, the color of the shampoo matches the bottle color and has a very pleasant, inviting and long lasting. The lather and feel of the shampoo is very good, rinsing is easy. The way your hair feels after your wash only is still pretty dry ( especially if you have dry, curly damaged hair). The conditioner does not have a gritty or super slick feel. It is very quick working and absolutely works wonders on your dry, curly, damaged hair. I would highly recommend these products and the hair treatment serum to EVERYONE and ANYONE. Even if you don't have curly hair. This Product definitely deserves its five star plus an extra one for the sleek designs! The only thing i would say to question is the ""after just one wash"". Yes I will completely honestly 100% admit it is much better after one wash, but continued use still shows the best results. I received these products from a Vox Box From L'Oreal Paris and Influenster to try out for FREE!!! Thank You all for Listening and A BIG THANK YOU TO L'Oreal Paris and Influenster for making this all possible!!!!"
Shampoo,amazon.com,Loreal Shampoo,2016-02-03 00:00:00,Extraordinary oil curls and dry hair loreal,"I received this complimentary of influenster. I have naturally curly hair and had it straightened over the summer and colored it throughout the years . As of late it's felt more dry. And I just received my voxbox from loreal. Sooooooo yay and I decided to try this. ( I have tried MANY products and have tried many products to not only tame but help with the structure of my curls, and non curls) I have shoulder length, I don't use any heat or other damaging items on my hair (other than the dying it. My first impression of this I like the color. It smells nice. While washing my hair I could feel the oil (if you've ever used coconut oil treatment on your hair, you know what I'm talking about) in the shampoo, and it lathered very nicely. After rinsing, I could definitely still feel that slick feeling in hair. I went on to the conditioner. The conditioner (equally as fragrant as the shampoo) recommends to leave it in your hair between 1-3 minutes, so while I finished my shower, I let the conditioner do it's thing. It rinsed out pretty well, again leaving that slickness. And than I used the mask cause my hair had been dried, I left that on for about 10ish minutes and washed out. After my shower, I draped a towel over my hair and I allowed my hair to air dry, my usual routine, then I brushed it out well. I really like the end result. My hair is shiny again :-)"
Shampoo,amazon.com,Loreal Shampoo,2016-02-03 00:00:00,Love it!,"I got this for free from influenster to try and I have to say I really like it. For reference my hair is naturally curly, dry, damaged, and colored. I found that this smells amazing and does a great job of making my hair feel nice and soft, however, as far as looks go I don't see much of any of a change (my hair just needs a good trim and I've also only been using it for about a week) but that's not to say it doesn't work. I think the shampoo does a nice job of cleansing and the conditioner does a nice job of locking in moisture. I also got the oil with it and I find that makes my hair feel good too. I think you might 'see' more of a difference with your hair if you also use the cream that goes along with it -- I don't have that so I can't say but I would assume so. All and all I'm really enjoying this line and once I go thru some more shampoos and conditioners I have I will definitely be buying it."

Shampoo,amazon.com,Tresemme Shampoo,19-02-18 0:00,Good stuff!,"When I received the hydrating mask it wasn't sealed and the jar didn't look full. At the time it was a special and only $2.50. I almost returned it but then figured for only $2.50, I'll just keep it. It looked 3/4 full. So I tried it. I washed my hair then rubbed the hydrating mask through it. I bundled up my hair and let it sit all morning before I rinsed it out. Kinda like a spa day a home! After I rinsed it out, my hair was super soft and silky. I will buy this again for sure. I don't know what it would be like it you only leave it in for a few minutes, but every Saturday now I leave it in for a few hours."
Shampoo,amazon.com,Tresemme Shampoo,19-02-18 0:00,"Smells nice, cleans well","I tried this shampoo on a whim as the kind I've been using for years was not available. I was a bit unsure of how it'd be, but I have no complaints with it. It leaves your hair smelling nice and fresh, but isn't an overpowering smell. It lathers and cleans nicely, and rinses well - doesn't leave your hair feeling heavy/weighed down or residue-y like some shampoos tend to do. My hair is left feeling clean and lightweight with volume and softness. I also have not had any issues with it affecting my hair color. I have natural blonde hair but I lighten it a bit, and so far it has not affected my hair color in any way. However, I am not sure how or even if it would affect hair color at all if you dye your hair a darker or different shade than your natural color, versus lightening it."

Shampoo,amazon.com,Tresemme Shampoo,2016-08-10 00:00:00,Good But Bottle Shrunk!,"Have always loved Tresemme - salon quality at prices that rival the horrible Suave or V whatever it is called. Very pleased with this shampoo. I have super thick curly hair which ends up very soft and smelling amazing after using this. My only issue is that the bottle size shrunk! My older bottles held more product. Still a good deal for the money, but I wish there was as much product as before."

Shampoo,amazon.com,Tresemme Shampoo,25-08-16 0:00,Won't save you from humidity frizz,"I was hoping I could use this to help keep some of the summer humidity frizz in check but no such luck. If you use too much it will (obviously) make your hair feel stiff and oily - but even using too much didn't keep the frizz at bay. Plus, there's a very thin line between enough and too much. Overall, I was disappointed and ended up spending extra money on Bumble and Bumble's Hairdresser's Invisible Oil Primer. That worked for me."

As to it making my teeth ""whiter"" and all the other claims, that has more to do with what you eat that stains your teeth than it does with the working power of the toothpaste, since they all claim that. Overall a good toothpaste (or gel) for the money and it comes from a nationally known company."

Toothpaste,amazon.com,Colgate Total Whitening Toothpaste,27-12-16 0:00,Doesn't cause any tooth sensitivity!,"I've been using toothpaste for tooth sensitivity for a while now because my teeth can be quite sensitive at times. Pro Enamel took care of it for the most part. But, I'd noticed some staining on my teeth that my hygienist has to work extra hard to remove (wine & coffee), so she suggested that I try using this toothpaste once per day, alternating with Pro Enamel once per day. I was expecting sensitivity problems to return, but I haven't had any! So, now I'm starting to use the Colgate Total Whitening more often, and so far, no problems with sensitivity! I've yet to convince my sister to try it, but I understand because many other brands do cause sensitivity. I always bought Crest or Colgate, whichever was cheapest, but I hadn't really considered that they may be different in how the varieties might be effecting my teeth. This works fine! I pride myself and having beautiful teeth, so I'm very happy that I found this works!"

The first time they came with an expiration date that was less than a year out.

Anyways, I was a bit apprehensive about buy them again but this time they have a date of nearly 2 years. That is more like it. I would suspect the first order was a fluke. My teeth and breath will be sparkling and fresh for awhile before I need to get more. HAHAHA"
